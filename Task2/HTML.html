    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Skype /ˈskaɪp/ specializes in providing video chat and voice calls from computers, tablets and mobile devices via
    the Internet to other devices or telephones/smartphones. Users can also send instant messages, exchange files
    and images, send video messages and create conference calls. Skype is available to download onto computers running
    Microsoft Windows, Mac or Linux, as well as Android, Blackberry, iOS and Windows Phone smartphones and tablets.
    Much of the service is free but users require Skype Credit or a subscription to call landline or mobile numbers.
    Skype is based on a freemium model.</p>
    <p>First released in August 2003, Skype was created by Dane Janus Friis and Swede Niklas Zennström in cooperation with
    Estonians Ahti Heinla, Priit Kasesalu, and Jaan Tallinn, who developed the backend which was also used in
    music-sharing application Kazaa. In September 2005, eBay acquired Skype for $2.6 billion. In September
    2009, Silver Lake, Andreessen Horowitz and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board announced the acquisition
    of 65% of Skype for $1.9 billion from eBay, valuing the business at $2.75 billion. Skype was later acquired by
    Microsoft in May 2011 for $8.5 billion. Microsoft's Skype division headquarters are in Luxembourg, but most of
    the development team and 44% of the overall employees of the division are still situated in Tallinn and Tartu,
    Estonia.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Why should I update my Skype Version?</dt>
                <dd>We want everyone to experience the best Skype has to offer – from enhanced quality to better reliability to
        improved security – and the newest version of Skype is the way to do that. So everyone can benefit from the
        latest improvements, from time to time we retire older versions of Skype across all platforms, including
        mobile devices. It’s easy to update Skype; once you do, you’ll have access to the latest features our team
        has worked hard to deliver.</dd>
            <dt>I can't sign in to Skype...</dt>
                <dd>Having trouble signing into Skype because you’ve forgotten your username or password? Don't worry, it happens.
        This guide will help you find an answer to your problem. If you can’t sign into Skype because you can’t
        connect to Skype, check here. If you can't sign in because you're being asked to download the latest version,
        follow the instructions here. You can sign into Skype with a Skype Name, Microsoft account, or Facebook account.
        Depending on which type of account you use to sign in, the sign-in process and account recovery steps are
        different. Click What type of account do I have? below if you don't know what type of account you use
        to sign in.</dd>
            <dt>What should I do if I get a blank blue screen when I try signing in to Skype for Windows desktop?</dt>
                <dd>When you try signing in to Skype for Windows desktop, you may sometimes get a blank blue screen displaying
        only the Skype logo. (You might also get a blank white screen if you're tying to sign in with a
        Microsoft account.) If you are experiencing this issue, the first step is to make sure you've upgraded to the
        most current version of Skype.</dd>
